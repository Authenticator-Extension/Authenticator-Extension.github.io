Authenticator Extension is an in-browser One-Time Password (OTP) client. Authenticator Extension supports both Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP, specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)) and HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP, specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226)).

In other words, Authenticator Extension can serve as a drop-in replacement for apps such as Google Authenticator.
